## General Information
- Background of your project :
  A bike-sharing system in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. It allow people to borrow a bike     from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

- Business probem : 
  The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

- Dataset used : 
  The data set covers the information on the various factors affecting demand of shared bikes, such as season, year, weather situation, temperature, humidity etc. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Temperature and Humidity are highly correlated with demand of bikes
- Summer and Fall Seasons have high demand of bikes
- Usually on holidays, demand of bikes is high
- Train and test datasets show very good fit by linear regression
